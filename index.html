                <p>
                    Family shelters provide secure, temporary refuge and a supportive environment to homeless families.
                    These shelters are also available specifically for abused women and their children.These family shelters are often times funded by the government but they sometimes also take private donations as well.

                <h3>Education for a child</h3>
                <p>
                    All over the world children, adolescents and whole families suffer from poverty, exclusion or have
                    no prospects in life. They don't attend school, can't get work and therefore have no chance of a
                    better future. Your donation will pave the way for a brighter future.
